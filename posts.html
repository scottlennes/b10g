<p>"Let's darty tonight."
    <br><br>
    The statement is, by the definition of darty (a party during the day) and the mutual exclusivity of night and day, false.
    Likewise, the statement "Logic is false," is also inherently false.
    Without logic, the criteria of truth can no longer be applied.
    Therefore, if logic does not hold, the criteria of truth cannot be applied to it.
    <br><br>
    Logic cannot be false.

<p>So let's get this started with a stream-of-consciousness autobiography.
    <br><br>
    My name is Scott. Scott Matthew Lennes, in full. 
    Something that's always struck me about my full name is the fact that every (sub?)name contains double letters: TT, TT, NN. 
    My parents must have loved the letter T. 
    Anyway, I am currently a junior at the University of Notre Dame studying Economics and Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics, the longest fucking name for a supplementary major you've ever seen, heard, read, whatever. 
    Maybe it's the name of the program that caught my eye. In addition to taking classes, I work for Campus Dining, mainly at a café formerly named Waddick's. 
    This semester, I also started working for a café located in Decio Hall fittingly named Decio Café. 
    <br><br>
    That's enough about me.
